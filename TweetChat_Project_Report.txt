TWEETCHAT PROJECT REPORT
========================

Project Overview
----------------
TweetChat is a real-time chat application demonstrating comparative implementation using Go for backend systems programming and Rust (Leptos framework) for frontend development. The application provides a complete chat system with user authentication, server creation/joining, and real-time messaging capabilities.

Architecture
-----------
- Backend: Go (Go 1.25.3) with SQLite database
- Frontend: Rust with Leptos framework compiled to WebAssembly
- Communication: REST API + WebSocket for real-time messaging
- Database: SQLite with modernc.org/sqlite driver (pure Go, no CGO)
